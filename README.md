How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I designed the CRUD module to encapsulate database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in distinct functions. This separation allows changes to be made in one place without affecting other parts of the code.
It makes the codebase easier to manage and reduces the risk of introducing bugs when modifying functionality.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I started by thoroughly analyzing the requirements provided by Grazioso Salvare. This involved clarifying any ambiguities and ensuring I understood the key functionalities needed for the dashboard. Unlike earlier assignments that may have focused solely on individual tasks, this project required integrating multiple components (data handling, UI, interactivity) into a cohesive application. For future projects, I would employ techniques such as wireframing and use of flowcharts to visualize data flow and user interactions. I adopted an iterative approach, developing features in small increments and continuously testing their functionality. This helped in catching issues early.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists develop algorithms, data structures, and systems that solve complex problems and improve processes. Their work is crucial in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and education. My work on the dashboard for Grazioso Salvare enables the organization to analyze and visualize animal rescue data effectively. This can lead to better decision-making, improved resource allocation, and ultimately, a greater impact on animal welfare. y providing tools that enhance operational efficiency, computer scientists contribute to an organization's ability to fulfill its mission, whether thatâ€™s saving animals or streamlining business processes. In summary, applying best practices in coding and systematic problem-solving approaches leads to robust, scalable solutions that can significantly benefit organizations.
